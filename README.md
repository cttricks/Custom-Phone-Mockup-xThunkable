In the above screenshot you can see there is the iOS phone mockup [ iPhone 8 Plus ] insted of default, you can switch this to android just by clicking the button at the top “Switch to Android/iOS“. This is button is added there by this extension so you can easily switch between iOS and Androis mockup easily while creating your project.
